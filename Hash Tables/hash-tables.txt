1. What is a hash table?
  A hash table is a speciaized array, where key values pairs are assigned an index in the array, 
  and the key has under gone hashing, in order to make it a numerical value or hash code.

2. What is hashing?
  A process taht takes data and converts it into a fixed-length numerical value, known as hash 
  code, through the use of a hashing function.

3. How does a hash table store data?
  Hash tables use a special method for storing data within arrays. First it takes the key and 
  hashes it through a hashing function to get a hash code, then another function determines the 
  true index of that data and stores both the key and its value at that index.

4. How are hash tables and objects different
  Objects are unordered lists of key value pairs, while hash tables have keys that have been 
  converted into hash codes, and are ordered by their true index value.

5. Determine whether you would use a hash table or an object to store each of the following 
  pieces of data:
*A list of pets and their unique names.
  I would use a hash table.
*The name, age, and the birthday of your best friend.
  I would use an object.
*The name and location of every company in a given city.
  I would use a hash table.
*All of the books checked out from a library by a particular individual.
  I would use an object.
*The primary and secondary phone numbers for a contact.
  I would use an object.
