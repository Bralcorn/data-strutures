Questions

1. What is the main difference between a stack and a queue?
  A stack is first in, last out, and a queue is first in, first out.

2. What are the similarities between stacks and queues?
  Both are data structures that use arrays to hold their data. Both 
  also use methods for removing and adding data.

3. Imagine you are an engineer tasked with implementing the UNDO and 
REDO options in a word processor such as Microsoft Word. Which data 
structure would you use for each option and why?

  I would use a stack for both functions, since you want the most recent 
  change to be the first one out, whether your REDOing or UNDOing.

Programming Questions

1. For this question, I will setup a arrays and then use the push and pop
  methods, along with a loop to reverse the string. *Javascript*

  var word = "Bloc!";
  var stack = word.split("");
  var length = stack.length;
  var reverse = "";

  for(var i=0; i < length; i++) {
    reverse = reverse += stack.pop();
  }

2.

  CLASS Stack
    FUNCTION pop(queue)
      ...fill in pseudocode here

      LOOP for current length of queue
        IF current loop equal to last
          RETURN first item in queue
        ELSE
          MOVE first item to end of queue
        END IF
      END LOOP  
    END FUNCTION
  END CLASS

3.

  CLASS QUEUE
    FUNCTION enqueue(element)
      ...fill in pseudocode here

      ADD element to end of queue

    END FUNCTION

    FUNCTION dequeue
      ...fill in pseudocode here

      SET first equal to first-element in queue
      REMOVE first-element in queue
      RETURN first

    END FUNCTION
  END CLASS
